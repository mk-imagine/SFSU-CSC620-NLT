    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement two improvements to your chatbot from HA1.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use word normalizations to make your chatbot less brittle.  Specifically, use NLTK's stemmer to accept word variations in the user's response.  For example, your chatbot should be able to understand (using normalization/stemming) that 'Can I (*)' and 'Could I (*)' map to the same response pair.  Print to the chatlog the original and the stemmed versions of the user input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compute and print the total count of types and the total count of tokens in the stemmed version of user's input from the chatlog (Ignore the chatbot responses for this part.)  Use 10-15 dialogues for this part.  Don't use NLTK's tokenizer.  Implement a simple tokenizer of your own. \n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* You choose the NLTK stemmer you would like to use in your program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Submit: \n",
    "1. The python program or ipython notebook\n",
    "2. Output from your program (chatlog and the counts)"
